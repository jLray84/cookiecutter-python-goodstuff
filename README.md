Python Goodstuff Cookiecutter
=============================

Bootstrap your new Python 3 project using Cookiecutter! Start your new package with testing, linting, coverage reports, and automatic releases right out of the box.

## Features 😎

* (Optional) Type checking with either [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) or [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/) 🔥
* No nonsense [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) configuration out of the box. 🎉
* Test coverage reports generated by [CoveragePy](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy). 📃
* [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) linter integrated with Pytest.
* Create a command line tool for installation with `pip`.
* (Optional) Support for Docker and containers. 🐳
* (Optional) Makefile for PyPi/Docker releases, tests, and more (Currently *nix Only). 🐧


## Get Started 🚀

Python Goodstuff relies on [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter); you will need it installed before you can start your new project!

Generating your new project is now as easy as one command:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:madelyneriksen/cookiecutter-python-goodstuff
```

Answer the questions when prompted, and Cookiecutter will generate your new project. Congrats, that's it! Now you just need to install your project:

```bash
cd my-project
virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
python setup.py install
```

Or, if you generated a Makefile and have GNU Make:

```bash
cd my-project
make test
```

## Testing Tools

Goodstuff creates tests run by Pytest, an assert-based testing framework and alternative to `unittest`. On invoking `pytest`, Pylint and PyCoverage will also run against your codebase, checking your code style and generating a coverage report.

**Tests with Virtualenv/venv**

If your environment is managed with `virtualenv` or `venv`, you can run your tests directly from the command line:

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
pytest
```

**Tests with Make**

With the optional Makefile, your tests will be run with `make test`, _along with_ your choice of type checking:

```bash
make test
```

## Command Line Interface

If you selected a command line interface option, Goodstuff will create a `bin/` folder with an executable named after your package:

```
bin/
└── myproject
```

This file creates a call to the `main` function in your package's `cli.py` file. Place all of your code and/or interfaces to be run into that `cli.py` function. When installed with `setup.py`, `pip`, or a tarball release, this script will automatically be added to your $PATH for usage from the command line.

## Docker Support 🐳

A Dockerfile for your project can be automatically created. Note that the generated Docker image assumes that you _also_ enabled a command line script:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.6-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/awesome-project

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
RUN python setup.py install

CMD awesome_project
```

The Dockerfile is based on an Alpine Linux base image 🌲. If you need glibc support, try the `debian-slim` images instead, which have fairly good compatibility without being too much larger than the Alpine images.

## Makefile (*nix Only)

If you have `/bin/bash` on your system plus common *nix utilities, you can use the Makefile for running tests, installing requirements, or building packages.

```bash
# Run Tests
make test
# Build a Release Package based on the version in VERSION
make build
```

The Makefile also integrates with Docker, making it easy to keep your images up to date:

```bash
# Build the current image based on VERSION, as well as update the latest
make docker-build
# Run the docker image
make docker-run
```
